For this assignment, we combined our new skill of using "while" statements/loops with our knowledge of if statements. This assignment was also designed to help build our coding intuition considering not all of the integers were laid out beforehand in the GLOW description. 

A tip I would've told past me was to think through the order of the code and what statements would be triggered by each integer as opposed to thinking through the assignment in the context of merely what statements I knew were necessary in the code.
