For this assignment, we attempted the state-based approach to show three different light patterns on the Lilypad board using Arduino code: flashing, fading, and continuous flashes of three in a row, otherwise known as being synchronous. 

A tip I would've told past me was to flesh out the pseudocode beforehand so that when there were mistakes, I was able to find qualitatively what should be happening instead. I also would tell myself that this is a great assignment to work with others on since putting our heads together really turned out to be the most efficient and generate the best code.
