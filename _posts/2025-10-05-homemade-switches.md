For this assignment, we built our own switches using a combination of conductive thread patches and conductive fabric patches. The goal was so that the LED would only turn on if both switches were pressed. The LED also should not have turned on when only one switch was on or neither was pressed. 

A note for this assignment: I was going to do sew my homemade switches into my embroidery sampler, but because my sampler was small, I didn't have the right amount of space to feel comfortable sewing larger patches. 

A tip I would've told past me was to get down the conserving thread satin stitch before having it appear many time as part of my switches.
