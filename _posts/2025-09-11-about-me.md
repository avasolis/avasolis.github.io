My name is Ava Solis. I'm a senior, 21 years old, and an English major. You can learn more about the English department here: [Williams College English Department](https://english.williams.edu)

I have _absolutely no_ programming experience. I've sewed a couple of times, but I'm definitely a beginner, and I can't wait to learn more. 

By the end of this class, I want to have a wearable design that I am proud of. Though the English major allows for a decent amount of creativity in terms of designing essay topics and writing, I haven't had many opportunities at Williams to be creative in the physical sense, so I am excited about that. I also want to feel more confident in my programming skills, or at least develop some skills, since I have no background in this area of study. A boring fact about me is that I do not like cream cheese.
