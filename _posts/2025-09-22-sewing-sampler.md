Creating my sampler was a lot of fun but certainly stressful at times. Many YouTube videos have different approaches to each stitch and I also messed up by not separating the thread for all of the stitches. My new stitches were the stem stitch and the split stitch. A tip I wish I told myself a few days ago would be to start early and always make sure you have enough thread for the amount of stitches you're trying to do. I found that I often would miscalculate which hurt the aesthetic.
