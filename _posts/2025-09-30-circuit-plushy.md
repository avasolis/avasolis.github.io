For this assignment, we had to use what we learned about circuits and electron flow and apply it with our newly learned sewing skills in the form of a plushy. Also a note: even though my plushy is not lit up in the image below, it works correctly! When the switch is on and the button is pressed, the LEDs turn on! When the switch is off or the button isn't pressed, otherwise known as the circuit being open, the LEDs do not turn on.

A tip I would've told past me was to plan, plan, plan. Whether that means allocating the appropriate amount of time to complete the assignment, cutting the right amounts of conductive thread, or just to spend some time logically thinking through how the circuit would work under different prototypes, I would've benefitted from a bit more foresight.
