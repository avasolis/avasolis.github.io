For this assignment, we had to use what we learned about circuits and electron flow and apply it with our newly learned sewing skills in the form of a plushy. 

A tip I would've told past me was to plan, plan, plan. Whether that means allocating the appropriate amount of time to complete the assignment, cutting the right amounts of conductive thread, or just to spend some time logically thinking through how the circuit would work under different prototypes, I would've benefitted from a bit more foresight.
