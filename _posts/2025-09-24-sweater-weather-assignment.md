For the "Sweater Weather" assignment, we had to experiment with using different variations of the if/else statements in C. We wrote our code in the context of temperature and its relationship to sweater weather. If it was cold, we could program our code to say "you should wear a sweater!". But if it was hot, we might say "a sweater definitely is not necessary.

A tip I would've told past me was that you have to put each condition in the correct order for the code to work, even if all of the statements make sense on their own.
