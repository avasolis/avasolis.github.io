I came to Williams because I wanted a liberal arts education. It was, and still is, the perfect place to learn a tons of information in an intimate setting. As I've fulfilled my major requirements, however, I've become disappointed that I haven't been able to explore as many departments as I once imagined. Now that it's my senior year, it's my last chance to explore new areas and squeeze the most out of Williams' unique liberal arts experience. eTextiles was of particular interest to me because I have always wanted to learn more about sewing and programming, and I didn't even know they could intersect! I'm excited at the prospect of creating something completely my own and exercising a creative part of my mind that is unrelated from traditional reading and writing like I do with my English major. I can't wait!
